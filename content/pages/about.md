Title: About me

Slug: about

My name is Pawel Ngei, I'm a full-stack web developer, cybersecurity educator, open science and free software activist and a former [Warsaw Hackerspace] facilitator.

I used to be fascinated by [transhumanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism), but I became disillusioned as I learned that its proponents are interested in growth for the sake of growth, without any critical thoughts on its direction. Right now I'm more closely aligned with [Solarpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk) and [hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic) sensibilities.

I have a background in basic mathematics, physics, neurobiology and computational neuroscience. I program mainly in TypeScript and Python and have experience in Linux systems administration.

My biggest projects include [Glider Ink](https://glider.ink/), a story explaining hackerspaces and hacker culture and [Solarpunk Prompts](https://podcast.tomasino.org/@SolarpunkPrompts), a podcast for climate fiction writers.

It's best to contact me via [email]. You can be also interested in my [github] account, although I'm not developing anything worthwhile at the moment.

I freelance as ALXD ([registry index](https://prod.ceidg.gov.pl/CEIDG/CEIDG.Public.UI/SearchDetails.aspx?Id=d9303664-0fe2-4dc0-aecb-797877c2d1ba)). You can also check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-ngei/) profile.

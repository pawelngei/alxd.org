Imagining a better future in the face of climate change is hard whether you use words - or images, as I have [written extensively](/solarpunk-lenses-and-foundations) before. With no proper _alphabet_, let alone a _dictionary_, conveying the meanings such as [degrowth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrowth) or [sharing economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharing_economy) requires a lot of careful, intentional work.

In the recent years, with the advent of generative AI we could see more and more articles on Solarpunk - or virtually anything - being illustrated by such mindless AI creations, [wasting resources](https://media.ccc.de/v/38c3-resource-consumption-of-ai-degrow-or-die) and stealing artstyles, while conveying nothing but vibes. Flooded by the sleek "trees on buildings" aesthetic we slowly lose any idea of what the better climate future ideas _can actually be_.

That's why together with almost a dozen artists, on the April 29th 2025 we launched the [Story Seed Library](https://storyseedlibrary.org/) - a new platform with intentional, human-made Solarpunk art licensed under a variety of [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) licenses.

Now every person looking for an illustration for their essay, zine or event poster can make use of the artworks generously donated by artists such as [Aerroscape](https://storyseedlibrary.org/authors/aerroscape/), [Astral Requin](https://storyseedlibrary.org/authors/astralrequin/), [Commando Jugendstil](https://storyseedlibrary.org/authors/commandojugendstil/), [Honora](https://storyseedlibrary.org/authors/honora/), [Jacob Coffin](https://storyseedlibrary.org/authors/jacobcoffin/), [Karl Schulschenk](https://storyseedlibrary.org/authors/karl-schulschenk/), [Lindsay Brown](https://storyseedlibrary.org/authors/lindsbrown/), [Lino Zeddies](https://storyseedlibrary.org/authors/linozeddies/), [Loop-chan](https://storyseedlibrary.org/authors/loop-chan/), [PannaN](https://storyseedlibrary.org/authors/panna-n/), [Scandinavian101](https://storyseedlibrary.org/authors/scandinavian101/), [Sean Bodley](https://storyseedlibrary.org/authors/seanbodley/), [SolHaelan](https://storyseedlibrary.org/authors/solhaelan/) or [The Lemonaut](https://storyseedlibrary.org/authors/thelemonaut/).

For anyone interested in joining, the submissions are [open](https://storyseedlibrary.org/pages/contribute/)!

My goal as the curator of the SSL is to create a good starting point introducing newcomers to the idea of Solarpunk as a realistic climate future. I'm still thinking what would be the best way to provide a space for more experimental - or fantastical - visions.

The Library also supports a [tagging system](https://storyseedlibrary.org/tags/) and a simple search, allowing users to browse by license type, theme, image orientation or style.

It's not only a place for visual art, but a new home for the [Story Seeds](https://storyseedlibrary.org/seeds/), Solarpunk scenes / ideas you know from the [Solarpunk Prompts podcast](https://podcast.tomasino.org/@SolarpunkPrompts) and [this blog](22-solarpunk-communities-and-story-hooks)! You can even find a few which haven't been made into proper podcast episodes yet!

The code generating the Library's webpage is freely available on both [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/alxd/storyseedlibrary) and [Github](https://github.com/pawelngei/storyseedlibrary), ready to take pull requests - or to form a base for another instance in case this one stops working. It has been created using the impressive [blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

I'd like to extend my gratitude to [Natalia Vish](https://nataliavish.com/) ([mastodon](https://mas.to/@karafuto)) who created the beautiful logo you can see above!

Thanks to everyone who contributed to creation of the library, especially (not in order): Scandinavian101, The Lemonaut, Clockwork and Martyna ≈Åysakiewicz!

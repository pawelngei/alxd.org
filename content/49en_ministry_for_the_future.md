As someone deeply interested in Solarpunk and climate fiction in general I encountered a lot of recommendations of "[The Ministry For The Future](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/50998056)" by the esteemed author [Kim Stanley Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Stanley_Robinson). The book was said to draw a grim, realistic, and yet still optimistic trajectory of our civilization towards a better, sustainable future past the Climate Catastrophe.

I have to admit that after getting about 30% in, I really struggled to continue. Finishing the book took me nearly 3 years, and I was able to do so only after realizing that I was reading a misprint! Instead of the monumental work of Kim Stanley Robinson, I got my hands on his marvellous self-aware satire on liberal economy, (not so) subtle racism, technosolutionism and Global North exceptionalism, titled "The Ministry For The Tourism in Zurich". It also explained the mysterious coupons to some Swiss cafes tucked behind the back sleeve.

The review below might contain spoilers for both books, so be warned!

## A good film should start with an earthquake

As far as I'm aware, both books start of with the same traumatic chapters describing a heatwave descending on India, killing millions with its [wet-bulb temperatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet-bulb_temperature). The descriptions are gory and distressing, allowing us to see the consequences of the Climate Catastrophe we're facing. The localized nature of the disaster, leaving almost no one alive in a whole province, spanning several cities and millions of people is a very intentional thought experiment by KSR. It lays ground for a huge political and cultural polarization of India, allowing it to completely change its government (and governance), economy and infrastructure, spearheading the sustainability revolution worldwide.

The concept itself - while I do not wish it upon anyone - is fascinating. Seeing how historically many cultures were able to shake off their stagnation only thanks to a war or a tremendous disaster, maybe a highly localized, traumatic event could change our outlook on the Climate Catastrophe as well?

In those first chapters, we don't follow any Indian, but Frank May, an American aid worker stealing (or rather: intentionally not sharing) water with those in need, which (together with a healthy dose of luck) allows him to survive the heatwave. It also leaves him with tremendous survivor's guilt.

## India - where the books split

The theme of India being a nation-, or rather a culture- spearheading the sustainable revolution and leading by example is the backbone of both books. What differentiates them is handling the perspectives and plots relating to it.

The rightly-acclaimed tMftF firmly places the camera in India and allows us to see the social changes from both personal, communal and societal perspectives. We follow the characters dealing with shock, processing their traumas, building the courage to oust their oil-supporting politicians and being brave enough to prototype different kinds of futures, unimaginable before the disaster. The later introduction of some UN and IMF figures struggling to understand the non-liberal-capitalist approaches only emphasize the contrast between what we take for granted now - and what we will need to make or tomorrow sustainable. Seeing how KSR is able to smoothly integrate different aspects of Indian culture, the complexities of Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam, the caste system into his story makes me wish more authors did their research so thoroughly.

Building on that monumental perspective, tMftTiZ uses a very self-aware trick of just _not caring_ about the changes in India, choosing to follow the UN and IMF-affiliated characters instead. Every few chapters they read some dry report about what those rebels came up with, a few times they even fly there in person to congratulate the revolutionaries, but are much more preocuppied with meeting bankers and enjoying their office parties in Zurich (more on that later).

The genius of KSR's approach here lies in highlighting something very vital, and yet omitted in other climate fiction: It's not that the social, economic, infrastructural changes _aren't happening_ all around the world, it's just that the West doesn't really care about them. The author doesn't have anyone arguing against the Indian approach, because that would already require acknowledging it. Thanks to that we can fully see and analyze the willing blindness of people staffing organizations like the UN, World Bank and IMF - even if it takes a little more context for someone not used to such subtle narratives.

## Processing trauma

In-between the "main" chapters propelling the plot forwards (India in -Future, Zurich in -Tourism) we come back to the character of Frank May, the deeply traumatized activist and one of the few survivors of the heatwave.

tMftF uses the American activist as a character study of a self-perceived white savior meeting a gallery of other people and communities, both in India and around the world. He's met with a variety of emotions, from hatred and disdain (for being the one who survived, even more so after his water theft becomes apparent), through pity or indifference, all the way to understanding and acceptance. His chaotic - yet - purposeful journey allows us to see more people working towards the change and slowly by slowly heal the immeasurable trauma. KSR's masterful strokes show us a stark contrast between misguided, individualistic attempts to process Frank's experiences - and true restoration he can only find by becoming part of a community (like the one in the refugee camp). He eventually becomes a kind of a networker - a role necessary in a sustainable world - connecting multiple groups and communities, allowing them to seamlessly work together and translating and cultural differences between them.

tMftTiZ shows its brilliance in translating Frank's chapters almost one-to-one, but with a completely different perspective. The activist is locked in his trauma and individualism, unable to connect to anyone despite multiple attempts at psychotherapy. Each of his attempts to join some initiaive or a community is fruitless. He even starts a family (in a white-savior mode, to save someone from a refugee camp), but quickly abandons it, aimlessly drifting forwards. He is never really challenged for being a survivor - all his guilt come from inside - but he struggles with a lot of anger, trying to join a terrorist organization (which turns him down for being white, more on that later) and eventually kills a random person.

The theme of Frank being some kind of "connection" between different worlds is present in both books. The -Future portrays him as someone matured and scarred, ready to listen to different perspectives and mediate between very different groups.

The -Tourism turns this upside down by having Frank be a "voice of conscience" of Mary, the head of the Ministry, kidnapping her and begging her to do something, a northern-savior stand-in for the voices of unseen billions suffering from the Climate Catastrophe. It's only at this point where we realize that the characters of the -Tourism have no meaningful relationships to the characters from the Global South, or even outside of the UN elites. Frank - an American scarred by a climate trauma - is then the only way to truly empathize with the non-Westerners whose agency remains invisible to the neoliberal discourse. Another subtle, and yet audacious stroke by KSR.

Spending a few chapters as a fugitive, Frank is eventually arrested and put in prison - a luxurious, comfortable prison, like everything in Zurich. He is sometimes visited by his abandoned and faceless family he can never relate to (they're not white or even Northerners). The only true connection he finds is Mary, the head of the Ministry he kidnapped before - who seems to relate to him spiritually, taking him for long mountain hikes (working like product placement, promoting the Swiss tourism for the readers).

In the final chapters of the book, Frank finds a community in a local co-op housing, making some friends we never see - tMftTiZ treats communities as something impossible to imagine and describe. Eventually, Frank dies to brain cancer, which conveniently guilts Mary and the Ministry into introducing a single law to _solve the refugee problem_, which hasn't ocurred to them before.

Only in the very last pages of the book we learn that _nothing is really solved_, because the refugees are struggling to find footing in the countries that accepted them, devoid of any contacts or social networks, still discriminated by the officials and the far-right movements alike.

I honestly wouldn't know how to read Frank, his struggles, and especially the painful last chapter about the refugees if it wouldn't be for the direct contrasts with the original -Future. Each story beat and theme seems to be there, but it's somehow _inverted_, _ridiculed_, where the inability for a Western reader to imagine a Global South person with any agency is so painfully visible.

Even contrasting the very last moments and their emotional reading is masterful. tMftF ends the refugee plot with a vibrant sense of solidarity across the regions and social groups, with new traditions of welcoming and supporting the new arrivals, while still acknowledging how we could do more. tMftTiZ on the other hand pretends to "solve" the problem by making it an economic decision - and then ignores all the consequences on the human scale, telling the refugees to _get a job_.

## What's happening on the ground



- Stagnation and blindness for activism - only high-level counts
- Passive refugees
- Activism in the North

## Flash-poetry

Both of the books are equally peppered with tiny "chapters" of flash-poetry, often in a form of a riddle, or near spiritual question posed to us by a photon, a molecule, or an unseen societal force.

I love how tMftF chooses to showcase a lot of values normally unknown to an average Western reader, such as the [Ubuntu philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy), introduce us to communal economic traditions such as the East African [Chamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chama_(investment)) and surprise us with an insightful take on a community forming, such as the [Tyranny of the Structurelessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tyranny_of_Structurelessness).

Again, tMftTiZ mirrors them almost one-to-one, but in addition to a few worthwhile concepts we get flooded with riddles about markets, the value of money and more. It brilliantly lulls us into expecting that the markets have all the answers we need, sans one:

> (...) I am the key that locks the back doors by which wrongdoers try to escape the scene of the crime. I am the nothing that makes everything happen. You don’t know me, you don’t understand me; and yet still, if you want justice, I will help you to find it. I am blockchain. I am encryption. I am code. Now put me to use.

How is this not a _masterful_ parody of technosolutionism?

## Racist hurricanes and earthquakes

- Global South? Everybody dies. Global North? Everybody survives!

## Clean, white hands

- White and priviliged characters (brown terrorists)



## In Economy we trust

- Economy is God

## Zurich life and cafe coupons!

- The pornography of Zurich - with cafe coupons!

> Switzerland. Think about how this little city-state of a country had gotten by in the world. In part it had been by accepting each other despite their differences. Some clever rules and a few mountain passes, both now irrelevant to power in the world; really it was just a system, a method. An old hoard and a way of getting along. The faces watching her now, their strange fairness, their insistence on some kind of justice for all. Some kind of enlightened self-interest, the notion that Switzerland was safest when the whole world was safe. Really very odd, this culture; and right now she wished with all her heart that it could conquer the world.


## Progress just happens

- It kinda just happens? We're not doing anything

## Magical technologies: social edition

- Climate-fixing nanorobots? No! Human greed-fixing Blockchain! Social magic technologies

## Lobbying is not termodynamics

- No counter-lobbyists

## Wrapping up

If you haven't spotted it yet, the review above is a painful parody.

"The Ministry For The Tourism In Zurich" doesn't exist. Kim Stanley Robinson penned only "The Ministry For The Future" with no (known to me) intent for it to be satirical.

I've been working on voicing my concerns with the book for years and chose to go with such a sarcastic comparison not because of my hatred towards KSR, but because I wanted to show how his book limits us in our imaginations of the future.

Many climate fiction enthusiasts I have spoken with over the years rightfully praise KSR for tackling such a daunting topic in a world where we cannot imagine _any_ climate future. I fully agree with them: a bold approach by a well-known author opened a lot of new readers to the movement.

At the same time, I think we _NEED_ to be aware of the book's limitations, often invisible to someone who hasn't experienced a lot of the situations described in it - or read less popular positions on the topic.

If we allow ourselves to read "The Ministry For The Future" as "let's continue with neo-liberal capitalism; blockchain will save us; let the brown people bloody their hands" we might delude ourselves into thinking that there's nothing more to do. We might refuse to answer any uncomfortable questions about our position in the world, hoping that after a lengthy career in banking or UN we rightfully deserve our peaceful retirement in the beautiful Alps. The world will sort itself out...

I'm a proponent of much more communal, involved and uncomfortable fiction, which forces us to look at the traumas and say that we need to face them - and there is hope beyond them. Those stories are much harder to tell - and even harder to publish, but I believe that we need them. If you would like to hear more about this approach, please check out the [Solarpunk Prompts podcast](/solarpunk-prompts-podcast).

We need to take many steps to imagine a sustainable future beyond the Climate Crisis. Kim Stanley Robinson's "Ministry..." is one of them, but let's not make it our last one.

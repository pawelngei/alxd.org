![Ministry for the Tourism in Zurich](/images/49_ministry/cover.jpg)

As someone deeply interested in Solarpunk and climate fiction in general I encountered a lot of recommendations of "[The Ministry For The Future](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/50998056)" by the esteemed author [Kim Stanley Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Stanley_Robinson). The book was said to draw a grim, realistic, and yet still optimistic trajectory of our civilization towards a better, sustainable future past the Climate Catastrophe.

I have to admit that after getting about 30% in, I really struggled to continue. Finishing the book took me nearly 3 years, and I was able to do so only after realizing that I was reading a misprint! Instead of the monumental work of Kim Stanley Robinson, I got my hands on his marvellous self-aware satire on liberal economy, (not so) subtle racism, technosolutionism and Global North exceptionalism, titled "The Ministry For The Tourism in Zurich". It also explained the mysterious coupons to some Swiss cafes tucked behind the back sleeve.

The review below might contain spoilers for both books, so be warned!

## A good book should start with an earthquake

As far as I'm aware, both books start of with the same traumatic chapters describing a heatwave descending on India, killing millions with its [wet-bulb temperatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet-bulb_temperature). The descriptions are gory and distressing, allowing us to see the consequences of the Climate Catastrophe we're facing. The localized nature of the disaster, leaving almost no one alive in a whole province, spanning several cities and millions of people is a very intentional thought experiment by KSR. It lays ground for a huge political and cultural polarization of India, allowing it to completely change its government (and governance), economy and infrastructure, spearheading the sustainability revolution worldwide.

The concept itself - while I do not wish it upon anyone - is fascinating. Seeing how historically many cultures were able to shake off their stagnation only thanks to a war or a tremendous disaster, maybe a highly localized, traumatic event could change our outlook on the Climate Catastrophe as well?

In those first chapters, we don't follow any Indian, but Frank May, an American aid worker stealing (or rather: intentionally not sharing) water with those in need, which (together with a healthy dose of luck) allows him to survive the heatwave. It also leaves him with tremendous survivor's guilt.

## India - where the books split

The theme of India being a nation-, or rather a culture- spearheading the sustainable revolution and leading by example is the backbone of both books. What differentiates them is handling the perspectives and plots relating to it.

The rightly-acclaimed tMftF firmly places the camera in India and allows us to see the social changes from both personal, communal and societal perspectives. We follow the characters dealing with shock, processing their traumas, building the courage to oust their oil-supporting politicians and being brave enough to prototype different kinds of futures, unimaginable before the disaster. The later introduction of some UN and IMF figures struggling to understand the non-liberal-capitalist approaches only emphasize the contrast between what we take for granted now - and what we will need to make or tomorrow sustainable. Seeing how KSR is able to smoothly integrate different aspects of Indian culture, the complexities of Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam, the caste system into his story makes me wish more authors did their research so thoroughly.

Building on that monumental perspective, tMftTiZ uses a very self-aware trick of just _not caring_ about the changes in India, choosing to follow the UN and IMF-affiliated characters instead. Every few chapters they read some dry report about what those rebels came up with, a few times they even fly there in person to congratulate the revolutionaries, but are much more preocuppied with meeting bankers and enjoying their office parties in Zurich (more on that later).

The genius of KSR's approach here lies in highlighting something very vital, and yet omitted in other climate fiction: It's not that the social, economic, infrastructural changes _aren't happening_ all around the world, it's just that the West doesn't really care about them. The author doesn't have anyone arguing against the Indian approach, because that would already require acknowledging it. Thanks to that we can fully see and analyze the willing blindness of people staffing organizations like the UN, World Bank and IMF - even if it takes a little more context for someone not used to such subtle narratives.

## Processing trauma

In-between the "main" chapters propelling the plot forwards (India in -Future, Zurich in -Tourism) we come back to the character of Frank May, the deeply traumatized activist and one of the few survivors of the heatwave.

tMftF uses the American activist as a character study of a self-perceived white savior meeting a gallery of other people and communities, both in India and around the world. He's met with a variety of emotions, from hatred and disdain (for being the one who survived, even more so after his water theft becomes apparent), through pity or indifference, all the way to understanding and acceptance. His chaotic - yet - purposeful journey allows us to see more people working towards the change and slowly by slowly heal the immeasurable trauma. KSR's masterful strokes show us a stark contrast between misguided, individualistic attempts to process Frank's experiences - and true restoration he can only find by becoming part of a community (like the one in the refugee camp). He eventually becomes a kind of a networker - a role necessary in a sustainable world - connecting multiple groups and communities, allowing them to seamlessly work together and translating and cultural differences between them.

tMftTiZ shows its brilliance in translating Frank's chapters almost one-to-one, but with a completely different perspective. The activist is locked in his trauma and individualism, unable to connect to anyone despite multiple attempts at psychotherapy. Each of his attempts to join some initiaive or a community is fruitless. He even starts a family (in a white-savior mode, to save someone from a refugee camp), but quickly abandons it, aimlessly drifting forwards. He is never really challenged for being a survivor - all his guilt come from inside - but he struggles with a lot of anger, trying to join a terrorist organization (which turns him down for being white, more on that later) and eventually kills a random person.

The theme of Frank being some kind of "connection" between different worlds is present in both books. The -Future portrays him as someone matured and scarred, ready to listen to different perspectives and mediate between very different groups.

The -Tourism turns this upside down by having Frank be a "voice of conscience" of Mary, the head of the Ministry, kidnapping her and begging her to do something, a northern-savior stand-in for the voices of unseen billions suffering from the Climate Catastrophe. It's only at this point where we realize that the characters of the -Tourism have no meaningful relationships to the characters from the Global South, or even outside of the UN elites. Frank - an American scarred by a climate trauma - is then the only way to truly empathize with the non-Westerners whose agency remains invisible to the neoliberal discourse. Another subtle, and yet audacious stroke by KSR.

Spending a few chapters as a fugitive, Frank is eventually arrested and put in prison - a luxurious, comfortable prison, like everything in Zurich. He is sometimes visited by his abandoned and faceless family he can never relate to (they're not white or even Northerners). The only true connection he finds is Mary, the head of the Ministry he kidnapped before - who seems to relate to him spiritually, taking him for long mountain hikes (working like product placement, promoting the Swiss tourism for the readers).

In the final chapters of the book, Frank finds a community in a local co-op housing, making some friends we never see - tMftTiZ treats communities as something impossible to imagine and describe. Eventually, Frank dies to brain cancer, which conveniently guilts Mary and the Ministry into introducing a single law to _solve the refugee problem_, which hasn't ocurred to them before.

Only in the very last pages of the book we learn that _nothing is really solved_, because the refugees are struggling to find footing in the countries that accepted them, devoid of any contacts or social networks, still discriminated by the officials and the far-right movements alike.

I honestly wouldn't know how to read Frank, his struggles, and especially the painful last chapter about the refugees if it wouldn't be for the direct contrasts with the original -Future. Each story beat and theme seems to be there, but it's somehow _inverted_, _ridiculed_, where the inability for a Western reader to imagine a Global South person with any agency is so painfully visible.

Even contrasting the very last moments and their emotional reading is masterful. tMftF ends the refugee plot with a vibrant sense of solidarity across the regions and social groups, with new traditions of welcoming and supporting the new arrivals, while still acknowledging how we could do more. tMftTiZ on the other hand pretends to "solve" the problem by making it an economic decision - and then ignores all the consequences on the human scale, telling the refugees to _get a job_.

## Social change on all and every level

What is possibly the most meaty and groundbreaking aspect of The Ministry for The Future is its focus on communities, activism and social change. Considering the plot spanning decades, and the space of only one book - not a whole series - we can see the beauty of old social systems changing or collapsing, replaced by the sustainable structures we need to push forward. Every economic decision of the distant UN / IMF / World Bank giants ripples and influences the lives of every single person and _we can see that_, appreciating their drive for agency and more horizontal power structures.

I'm still not able to say which chapters I love the most: the total upturning of the old order in India, Frank's painful-but-inspiring encounters with activists around the world, or the small vingettes of social action from all around the world. Kim Stanley Robinson did a splendid job incorporating existing organizations and projects into the plot, allowing us to apprieciate the multitude of initiatives and struggles we need to get to a better future.

Frank's naive western perspective is used as a wonderful plot device, contrasting with what he finds on the ground, especially in the refugee camp chapters. When he visits the camp for the first time, he expects to be some kind of a powerless but noble white savior among stagnant, traumatised and burned out people. I think many readers were as shocked as Frank himself realizing that the camps are full of social programs, therapy sessions, technological innovation organized by the refugees themselves, with only a little coordination from outside. I really appreciate mentioning organizations such as the [r0g_agency](https://openculture.agency/) doing actual work on the ground and treating the camp inhabitants as equals, not just clients.

I can also fully understand how the chapters set in the West could be uncomfortable to a lot of readers, going far past non-violent protests or even clashing with the police, openly criticizing institutions we take for granted and building parallel infrastructures, like the ones based on German [Freifunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freifunk).

tMftF does a brilliant job showcasing those small, grassroots, independent movements as the real engine for the change - and their trajectory from being invisible, ignored by the Big Players over their heads - through conflicts, hostile takeovers, greenwashing - all the way to their acceptance and re-drafting the social contracts and even constitutions of their societies.

tMftTiZ takes the exact same themes and story beats and again - inverts them as a really creative social commentary to what is impossible to even imagine in our western, neoliberal societies.

With most of the Indian chapters cut out or just summarized, we're mostly left with the voyages of Frank - this time not as a networker showcasing different communities, but a solitary white savior burning out in one context after another. His expectations of the passivity of the refugees are played straight (which might be surprising and very boring if you don't have the context of the original book).

The same goes for every unrelated vingette - we can only see people, especially in the Global South - passively responding to changes ordained by the Powers That Be, World Bank, IMF, UN or others. A dull farmer surprised that they can get money from the fancy city people for "farming dirt" (one of the carbon drawdown initiatives) really rubs this in - the englightened West is the only moral actor capable of saving the savages from the Climate Crisis.

The only criticism I would have for this aspect of Kim Stanley Robinson's satire is the lack of focus on the Northern grassroots. After chapter 55 featuring a failed "revolution" in France we don't see much action in the West until the implementation of the government-ordained rewilding programs in the US. I understand that KSR wants to emphasize how unimaginable social change would be for a Westerner, but he did a much better job with India: having even the titular Ministry acknowledge it, but totally ignore its significance.

The -Tourism presents all indicators of social change as dry reports read by the members of the Ministry, but never dwells deeper. Creating a huge social network, overturning old currencies and business models, limiting and then effectively banning air travel are just _things that happen_, with no real feedback, protests, or far-reaching ripples in our cultures and societies. The eternal Switzerland stays the same.

What might be possibly the biggest stroke of satirical genius (or just an unwillingness to delete so much content from the original book) Kim Stanley Robinson dedicates a whole chapter (#85) of the -Tourism to a comprehensive list of organizations who helped create a better world. What we saw in action in the -Future is just a dry list, _hey those Kenyans and Colombians did something too I guess_, which is just such a masterful caricature of many Western conferences and "inclusivity programs".

## Flash-poetry

Both of the books are equally peppered with tiny "chapters" of flash-poetry, often in a form of a riddle, or near spiritual question posed to us by a photon, a molecule, or an unseen societal force.

I love how tMftF chooses to showcase a lot of values normally unknown to an average Western reader, such as the [Ubuntu philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy), introduce us to communal economic traditions such as the East African [Chamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chama_(investment)) and surprise us with an insightful take on community forming, such as the [Tyranny of the Structurelessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tyranny_of_Structurelessness).

Again, tMftTiZ mirrors them almost one-to-one, but in addition to a few worthwhile concepts we get flooded with riddles about markets, the value of money and more. It brilliantly lulls us into expecting that the markets have all the answers we need, sans one:

> (...) I am the key that locks the back doors by which wrongdoers try to escape the scene of the crime. I am the nothing that makes everything happen. You don’t know me, you don’t understand me; and yet still, if you want justice, I will help you to find it. I am blockchain. I am encryption. I am code. Now put me to use.

How is this not a _masterful_ parody of technosolutionism?

## Racist hurricanes and forest fires

You cannot write a climate fiction without some disasters. Not just those drawn out in months and years, but a sudden flood, forest fire or something equally dramatic.

KSR decided to include those events in his books even if they happen outside of where the camera normally stays. We get quite a few smaller chapters describing a community facing a disaster completely destroying their homes and livelyhoods. It keeps us on our toes, reminding us the stakes, but it never gets to the point of the very first chapter and the Indian heatwave.

Despite its satirical outlook, tMftTiZ doesn't negate those events and presents them as destructive. KSR's pen is a little more subtle, playing with our Western biases: every time a disaster strikes in the Global North, only few people die. Individualistic capitalists not caring about their communities somehow start _working together_, the crumbling infrastructure of (*checks notes*) Los Angeles proves... superior...? The civilization triumphs.

Meanwhile, chapters set in the Global South? Oh boy, those poor fellows, all dead. Or fled to the North as refugees. If anyone survived, it's thanks to UN, or whichever Western government that liberated the slaves, sent aid, etc, etc. We don't see anyone in the South forming support networks, creating makeshift infrastructure, or even having any kinds of agency.

The narratives we can stomach don't have place for the Southern agency in them.

## Clean, white hands

Kim Stanley Robinson does not shy away from exploring really hard topics like the role of violence and eco-terrorism within the societal transformation. The openness of his approach caused quite a big controversy, to the point of a [mysteriously malfunctioning microphone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WF7j7J84Tdk&t=2280s) during one of his lectures at the University of Zurich.

The tMftF welcomes us to a multi-faceted exploration of different forms of violence, its targets, perpetrators and consequences both for the individuals and communities. It gives us a quick overview of the history of civil right movements worldwide and illustrates the mechanisms of backlash from the states, now armed with both physical and online surveiliance tools. I think that writing the characters' and communities' decisions as ambigious and leaving the reader with some open questions was a really thoughtful choice.

Having said this, the inclusion of outright violence, terrorism and assassinations (one even described in-depth) in tMftTiZ was quite surprising to me, as I fully expected it to go with a neoliberal status quo all the way. The satirical book replaces the deep character studies and hard questions with a straw-man-y terrorist organization killing the world's oligarchs and shooting down planes - with absolutely no backlash from any world's government or InterPol.

It took me a longer moment to process KSR's narrative on violence. Why does a _satirical_ book assume that the violence is necessary, and yet presents it so... cartoonishly? How does that criticize the current status quo...?

Then I realized: (almost?) none of the characters commiting violence is white. Most of them come from India (see, they are doing something in this book!). Every time any kind of civil disobedience is described in the North, it's non-violent, fleeting, just as a symbol of protest. When the police asks insistently enough, we finally go home.

The civilized, Western kind of violence becomes even more cartoonish to stay within the PG-12 rating of the neoliberal discourse. One of the chapters of tMftTiZ describes a mysterious coordinated attack on The World Economic Forum in Davos, which becomes completely cut off from the outside world, with all the billionaires, bankers, governmental officials and lobbyists kidnapped and on the mercy of the assailiants.

Is this a site of a massacre? No! The distressed 0.01% are treated humanely, asked to watch some movies about the planet dying and starving children suffering, then let go with a warning. No poisons, no tracking chips, just... a stern talking-to.

The police and military laying siege seemed to get the same note about PG-12 rating of this chapter, as no one of the mysterious terrorists was really pursued.

I have to admit that this was one of the most thinly veiled pieces of satire within the book, which made me wonder if anyone could read tMftTiZ with a straight face.

The subtlety came back in the following chapters, where it takes us a good while to realize that all of the main characters are white, priviliged Northerners - with the exception of one of the Ministry's employees, an Indian, who luckilky turns out to be the mastermind behind the terror plots.

No white hands were bloodied.

## In Economy we trust

I feel that the Economy themes in both books are very uneven. With its finite number of pages the -Future does its best to present the social and infrastructural consequences of a lot of projects, such as [Global Carbon Reward](https://globalcarbonreward.org/) (and how it can be gamed), [Modern Monetary Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_monetary_theory), the profileration of the [Mondragon cooperatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation) or the evolution of the Global South traditions and institutions, like the East African [Chamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chama_(investment)) and Saccos. You can feel that it just scratches the surface, showing us a few trends as studies of a live communities - yet it's honest in not pretending to have any of the Big Answers - or maybe not even claiming that any of them exist.

The occassional chapter showing the perspective of the Ministry, with its economists trying to make sense of any of the data they see is just a beautiful example of bias and bad modelling in economy, which later leads to a beautfiul culmination of creating more open and citizen-oriented tools to analyze the myriad of factors, independent from any single organization.

Possibly the most grim chapters since the opening one, the corporate warfare and assassinations of the labour leaders might be shocking to some readers, but I really appreciate how KSR doesn't put blame on a single exec. Again, he shows us how the hierarchical structures of the magacorporations naturally promote psycho- and sociopaths optimizing for profit and profit only.

Yet again, the -Tourism flips the whole narrative on its head. With a strong focus on the Ministry and the way it sees the world, most of the plot revolves around pushing this- or that- proposal to this- and that- banking, national, international body. We essentially don't see the effects of the regulations, austerities and bailouts.

KSR rightfully satirizes the _obviousness_ of our current approach, where we _must_ make sure that the international oil giants will find more work, government subsidies and grants, instead of being - say - nationalized and liquidated. That's how Shell, BP and the militaries of the world start working together pumping water from under the sliding glaciers on top of them to re-freeze. The reader never gets a moment to ask themselves: what will happen when they... solve the problem? Won't they be incentivized to sabotage the sustainability effort to keep their business?

The Mondragon cooperatives are still mentioned in the -Tourism, but they're too _communal_ to pay them any attention. Instead, we dedicate all our focus towards MMT and Global Carbon Rewards - or rather, Blockchain in general - which are Mathematically Correct and work Flawlessly™, with no drawbacks, no social implications.

By the end of the -Tourism the satire becomes a little more vulgar, with the giants like Amazon failing in the span of paragraphs, with no death throes or social unrest. They just stop being... a thing...? For the corporations that continue existing, the mathematical magic of Blockchain and the Carbon Coin makes them Good™, removing all economic incentives for lobbying for manipulation. I had a feeling that Kim Stanley Robinson either got tired of parodying our blind belief in economy, or just wanted to slap the few people who did not get the already thinly veiled joke.

## Zurich life and cafe coupons!

Finally, the place which gave "The Ministry..." it's title! Having ignored India and other countries spearheading the green revolution, KSR spends what feels like 30-40% of his parody in the biggest city of Switzerland.

And what a city it is! Every time we go back to the character of Mary, we get a recommendation of some cafe or restaurant, complete with its special dish or drink and a detailed description how to get there by tram (sadly, no Google Maps links in the eBook). The Ministry often visits them, discussing their favorite spots in-between reading reports on the impending doom and millions of dead.

At one point Frank visits Zurich as a fugitive, hiding from the police, but even he cannot resist coming to a cafe and listening to a meeting of a local sustainability club:

> The Swiss were extremely regular in their appearance, but then on consideration Frank realized that this was basically true everywhere. The meeting began on time, of course, and it had a schedule that was gotten through briskly. Frank’s German was not up to the task, and this was Schwyzerdüütsch to boot, so he was completely lost and could only pretend to be comprehending, but no one seemed to notice. Their guttural looping sentences were calm, and they laughed pretty often. When they saw he was there, and that there were some other Ausländer there also, they summarized their proceedings in quick rough English. He liked the feel of the meeting, nothing dogmatic or virtuous about it, just people pursuing a project; something between a committee meeting and a party planning exercise. Like the local Swiss Alpine Club, no doubt, and in fact when he asked about that, he found that many there were in both clubs. Party planning— political parties— he wondered if the same word for both was the case in German also. Partei, yes. But birthday party? Maybe so. He wished he had brought along a translation earbud.

Did I mention the splendid, wonderful swimming clubs with access to the lake, for just a small monthly fee? Have you ever marvelled at how _clean_ Zurich is? How masterfully planned? What an aesthetic dream it is, tastefully mixing the old with the new, all under the beautiful watch of the Alps.

I don't know if the book got any official sponsorship from either Switzerland or the city of Zurich, or if KSR decided to just treat to with some absurd levels of "click here and subscribe!", but the satire does its job very well. When one of the characters is faced with tragic personal news, her internal monologue reads:

> Switzerland. Think about how this little city-state of a country had gotten by in the world. In part it had been by accepting each other despite their differences. Some clever rules and a few mountain passes, both now irrelevant to power in the world; really it was just a system, a method. An old hoard and a way of getting along. The faces watching her now, their strange fairness, their insistence on some kind of justice for all. Some kind of enlightened self-interest, the notion that Switzerland was safest when the whole world was safe. Really very odd, this culture; and right now she wished with all her heart that it could conquer the world.

Just stop for a moment an think about the genius of this approach: the employees of the Ministry are well aware that there are countries actively saving the world by example and _choose not to think about them_, instead wishing for one of the most _stereotypically greedy_ countries to take over the world. The solution is _right there_, in a report on your desk, but you choose to give your life to the banks and vaults in the Alps.

If this paragraph doesn't make us question everything about our civilization, what could?

## Progress is inevitable, the plot doesn't need an engine

What really shines through both of the books is Kim Stanley Robinson's mastery over weaving the worldbuilding and pacing - and his awareness of how absurdly it can be subverted.

The Ministry For The Future centers the plot in India, weaving in Frank visiting seemingly unrelated communities and peppering in some vingettes. Only when Frank starts seriously dealing with his trauma and becomes a networker between different groups and organizations we can start seeing the sub-plots weave into a coherent braid, with their successes and struggles serving as a dramatic heartbeat of the whole book. The dramatic - and partially unexpected - culmination at the 58th COP made me shed a tear, as Frank visited and recognized so many of the old friends he thought lost - and we thought not important to the story. While it's not exactly what Jeff Gomez calls [a collective journey](https://blog.collectivejourney.com/), I could really feel that the main character of the Ministry is not only a community, but a _global collective of communities_ building a better world.

Having constructed such a dramatic masteriece, KSR easily deconstructs it in the -Tourism by removing the plot engine. Despite each of the satirical chapters being written equally well as the original, there are no story beats, no overarching structure, things just _happen_. I don't think a lesser writer would be able to transform such a pointless structure into something you can still semi-pleasantly read, but KSR nails just that.

In all of the -Tourism sublots, things just _happen_ without any kind of... drive, sense of progress or goal. Frank stumbles from one place (because it's not a community) to another, Mary pushes the Ministry to beg bankers to change their ways, some city gets flooded, some terrorists attack something, the Ministry gets attacked, Mary needs to escape, then come back, someone dies, some consequences of something happen. Then the world is saved! Mary and the Ministry can retire in the Eternal Switzerland, their neoliberal duty to the Status Quo fulfilled.

I haven't read any other book so openly parodying our convictions about the Unstoppable March Of Progress with it's _very structure_. If we didn't need The Ministry for the Future so badly as a signpost of _where to go_, I would be tempted to call the -Tourism a more masterful book just for this self-aware mockery.

Actually, I might be lying about the complete lack of story beats. There is one moment in the -Tourism which clearly reads as a breaking point, where the world changes: it's the introduction of the Blockchain by the Swiss banks. It clearly divides the book in the "no can do" epoch and "everything is being fixed" epoch.

## Magical technologies: social edition



- Climate-fixing nanorobots? No! Human greed-fixing Blockchain! Social magic technologies
- Blockchain social media!

## Lobbying is not thermodynamics

- No counter-lobbyists
- Fukuyama's critique

It's worth noting that the satire of the -Tourism got praised by no one else than [Francis Fukuyama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Fukuyama), who in his review in [American Purpose](https://www.americanpurpose.com/blog/fukuyama/were-cooked/) stated that the novel is "ludicrously unrealistic" and "Robinson posits the most optimistic possible political developments at every turn."

## Wrapping up

If you haven't spotted it yet, the review above is a painful parody.

"The Ministry For The Tourism In Zurich" doesn't exist. What I'm describing is  "The Ministry For The Future", which Kim Stanley Robinson penned with no (known to me) intent for it to be satirical. The book I keep comparing it to with the same title was never written.

I've been working on voicing my concerns about the book for years and chose to go with such a sarcastic comparison not because of my hatred towards KSR, but because I wanted to show how his book limits us in our imaginations of the future.

Many climate fiction enthusiasts I have spoken with over the years rightfully praise KSR for tackling such a daunting topic in a world where we cannot imagine _any_ climate future. I fully agree with them: a bold approach by a well-known author opened a lot of new readers to the movement.

At the same time, I think we _NEED_ to be aware of the book's limitations, often invisible to someone who hasn't experienced a lot of the situations described in it - or read less popular positions on the topic.

If we allow ourselves to read "The Ministry For The Future" as "let's continue with neo-liberal capitalism; blockchain will save us; let the brown people bloody their hands" we might delude ourselves into thinking that there's nothing more to do. We might refuse to answer any uncomfortable questions about our position in the world, hoping that after a lengthy career in banking or UN we rightfully deserve our peaceful retirement in the beautiful Alps. The world will sort itself out...

I'm a proponent of much more communal, involved and uncomfortable fiction, which forces us to look at the traumas and say that we need to face them - and there is hope beyond them. Those stories are much harder to tell - and even harder to publish, but I believe that we need them. If you would like to hear more about this approach, please check out the [Solarpunk Prompts podcast](/solarpunk-prompts-podcast).

We need to take many steps to imagine a sustainable future beyond the Climate Crisis. Kim Stanley Robinson's "Ministry..." is one of them, but let's not make it our last one.

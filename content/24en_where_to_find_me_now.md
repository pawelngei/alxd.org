After deleting my Facebook account I decided to reorganize my social media life. There are many, many arguments why to leave Facebook: a "simple" privacy preference, unwillingness to allow mass-manipulation of votes by data mining companies, fear of a potential addiction to likes/shares and shortening our attention spans.

For me the most important was the realization that Facebook is manipulating me directly. I began seeing that only a small subset friends and news articles appear in my feed. I could try countering that with few options like "unfollow" and "close friends", but that would only give the giant more data about me! While I _somehow_ accepted that every single like I click gets quantified and sold, the _outrage porn_ Facebook served me every day and a strong disincentive to contact my less-polarized friends strongly affected my worldview and well-being.

I no longer wish to take part of that. I'm not interested in outrage porn and clickbaits, especially knowing how much I enjoy them. Instead, I want to read more worthwhile articles, blogposts and books. My [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) is full of things I can read instead of mindlessly scrolling another infinite stream.

After unfollowing `r/funny` and similar, I want to still use [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) for discussions with a variety of communities, and I leave my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PawelNgei) account to contact people who persistently ignore emails. You won't see me sharing a lot on these two, though.

All of the longer articles will stay on this blog, and I have some really interesting ones waiting to be published. Remember you can subscribe to [RSS](feeds/all.atom.xml) with any client you want!

For more frequent updates, book and music recommendations please check out my [Mastodon](https://chaos.social/@alxd). It's an awesome new federated social network which allows people from different servers to communicate with each other, blue bird-style. There are no magical algorithms, the messages are sorted chronologically - so it's much harder to hijack your attention! Mastodon is beautifully explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPSbNdBmWKE) - it's a part of [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), similar to Diaspora I used to contribute to some years ago.

I feel that the decision to leave Facebook has made me a better, more focused human being and I recommend you to consider the same. True, I'm not invited to as many events as before, but now I know that I stay in contact with my true friends, not just the ones _suggested_ by somebody or something.

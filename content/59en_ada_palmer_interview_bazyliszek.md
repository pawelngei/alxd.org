For this year's edition the Warsaw sci-fi/fantasy convention [Bazyliszek](https://bazyliszek.ava.waw.pl/) invited a special guest: a historian and a science fiction author [Ada Palmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Palmer) [[Homepage](https://www.adapalmer.com/)]. Despite a long day taking parts in other panels, she agreed to give me an interview about her specialty: the history of ideas - and how it relates to our struggles with climate imagination and Solarpunk.

You can listen to it as a special episode of [Solarpunk Promts](https://podcast.tomasino.org/@SolarpunkPrompts/episodes/special-interview-with-ada-palmer-history-of-ideas-and-our-climate-imaginations), also on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/5igXOJCAouTWaEFUQAFRsK) and [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/solarpunk-prompts/id1652252771)!

Professor Palmer touches a lot of topics, including the ideas of purity, millenarianism, the (misconceptions about the) fall of Rome, the [Daybreak](https://daybreakgame.org/) game and [Astro Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro_Boy). More sources in the podcast description!
